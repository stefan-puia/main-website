I'm currently maintaining a fork of a popular discord bot, [NadekoBot](https://nadeko.bot/). (Forked from <https://gitlab.com/Kwoth/nadekobot>)

My additions to this fork include custom commands that were required by the Discord servers that I'm administering, such as:
* pruning messages older than a specified amount of time
* generating raid compositions automatically with the [raid composition tool](https://stefanpuia.co.uk/blog/world-of-warcraft-raid-composition-tool/) based on sign-ups from the [raid-helper](https://raid-helper.dev/) bot
* discord role checks
