    First blog post! I thought I'd start with why there's foxes everywhere.

After a long, long procrastination, I've finally decided to get this website up instead of a static page that said I didn't do it ðŸ˜…. I'm pretty happy about how it turned out. Big shout out to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [netlify-cms](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and [cloudflare ](https://www.cloudflare.com/)for making this possible. I'll be making a little post about how it all works at some point. I know there are a billion tutorials around for making static website generators, but honestly, it is **so easy**. It literally took me a weekend to get this whole thing up.

Back to the question at hand, what's up with the foxes everywhere?
