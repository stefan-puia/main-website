  description: A breakdown of how I made this website.

I have promised to make this in the "[why the foxes](/blog/so-whats-up-with-the-fox/)" post, so here it is! ðŸ˜„

First off, I'd like to give [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) a shoutout since this whole website was made based on [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wD00RT6d-g).
